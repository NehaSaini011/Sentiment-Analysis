# Project Analysis with GitHub, Google Colab, and Mendeley

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates how to manage a research or analysis workflow using three key tools:
- **GitHub** for version control and collaboration.
- **Google Colab** for writing and running analysis scripts in Python.
- **Mendeley** for managing references and citations in the final report.

The integration of these tools ensures that the project is reproducible, well-documented, and academically sound.

## ⚙️ Tools Used
- **GitHub** → Maintains code, scripts, and project reports with version history.  
- **Google Colab** → Provides a cloud-based environment to run Python scripts without local setup.  
- **Mendeley** → Manages research references and automatically generates bibliographies.

## 🚀 Workflow
1. **Set up GitHub Repository**  
   - Create a repository to store code, data, and reports.  
   - Maintain all versions using Git.  

2. **Run Analysis in Google Colab**  
   - Write and execute Python code in Colab notebooks.  
   - Save notebooks and results back to GitHub for version tracking.  

3. **Manage References with Mendeley**  
   - Import and organize research papers.  
   - Insert citations and export bibliography for the report.
